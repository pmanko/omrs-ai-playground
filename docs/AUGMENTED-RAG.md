You're looking for a comprehensive plan and concept index for our RAG approach, specifically leveraging Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B for the initial embedding step. This is a robust and resource-efficient choice for demonstrating the value of semantic search in our clinical AI system.
This plan will detail the overall architecture, the roles of each component, and the step-by-step implementation, including the advanced hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach that incorporates Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B.
Comprehensive Plan: A2A-Enabled Multi-Agent Medical System with Hybrid RAG
Vision & Goal: To create a proof-of-concept multi-agent medical chat application that demonstrates the core principles of the emerging Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, connecting to live and local FHIR data sources, and incorporating a sophisticated hybrid RAG approach for intelligent information retrieval from both structured and unstructured clinical data. The system will embody a "Mixture of Experts" philosophy, ensuring each task is handled by the optimal model.
1. The Role of Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B in Hybrid RAG
Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B is selected for the initial embedding step due to its balance of efficiency and performance.
• Specifications: It has 595 Million parameters, 1024 embedding dimensions, a max token limit of 32768, and a retrieval score of 64.65%. Its memory usage is approximately 2.27 GB, making it significantly lighter than larger models while maintaining competitive performance.
• Rationale: It's an excellent choice for a Proof of Concept (POC) because it offers solid retrieval performance with a small memory footprint, enabling quick iteration and local testing, and can handle various lengths of clinical notes effectively.
• Distinct Role: It's crucial to understand that Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B is a specialized text-embedding model used for text-to-text semantic search. Its purpose is to convert textual data into vectors for efficient retrieval. This is distinct from:
    ◦ MedSigLIP, which is a vision encoder designed for image-text matching and multimodal applications.
    ◦ MedGemma's internal text encoder, which is part of its generative model and optimized for sequence prediction (generating text), not for creating highly accurate "semantic addresses" for retrieval.
2. Architectural Foundation: Simulating an A2A Ecosystem
Our system simulates key A2A concepts within its Python backend to enable a dynamic, decentralized model:
• The Agent Registry (Simulated Discovery): A shared Python dictionary that acts as a service discovery mechanism. Agents register their unique agent_id, capabilities, and task_name upon startup, allowing other agents to look up available services.
• The A2A Message Bus (Simulated Communication): An in-memory message queue (e.g., Python's queue.Queue) that decouples agents. Instead of direct calls, agents post messages to the bus and listen for messages addressed to them, simulating a peer-to-peer network.
• The Standardized Message Format: All messages on the bus adhere to a consistent JSON structure (message_id, sender_id, receiver_id, task_name, payload, status), serving as our internal communication protocol.
3. The Agents and Their A2A Roles
Each agent operates as an independent worker process, leveraging a single headless LM Studio server (or cloud APIs) for their LLM "brains".
• user_proxy_agent (Orchestrator):
    ◦ Listens for initial user queries from the web UI and initiates the first task.
    ◦ Performs semantic routing by prompting an LLM (Llama 3 or Gemini) to intelligently analyze the user's query and the Agent Registry's capabilities to select the best specialist agent and its parameterized skill.
    ◦ Creates a new message with the appropriate task_name and receiver_id, posting it to the Message Bus for the chosen specialist.
    ◦ Supports two orchestrator options: Gemini API (cloud-based) or Llama 3 8B Instruct (local, OpenAI-compatible LM Studio endpoint).
• medgemma_agent:
    ◦ Provides expert answers to general medical questions by leveraging the MedGemma model for clinical synthesis and text generation.
    ◦ Registers the skill answer_medical_question.
• clinical_research_agent: (Consolidated from openmrs_fhir_agent and local_datastore_agent).
    ◦ Handles all patient context queries by registering a single clinical_research skill that accepts a scope parameter (facility or hie). This avoids agent proliferation and keeps capability metadata clean.
    ◦ Dual-Prompt Capabilities: Internally uses two distinct system prompts:
        ▪ FHIR API Prompt: Generates FHIR API GET paths (no host) for querying live FHIR endpoints like OpenMRS.
        ▪ SQL Prompt: Generates precise SQL SELECT queries targeting Parquet-on-FHIR tables (e.g., observation, patient) for local Spark-based FHIR repositories. It uses PyHive for Spark Thrift communication.
    ◦ Scope Enforcement: The orchestrator determines the scope (facility or hie), and the agent's logic enforces relevant constraints (e.g., including facility_id predicates for facility scope queries).
    ◦ Clinical Synthesis with MedGemma: After executing the query and retrieving structured data (JSON from FHIR API or rows from Spark SQL), this agent injects the data into a prompt for the MedGemma LLM for final clinical synthesis and human-readable answer generation. This ensures the specialized MedGemma provides the clinically nuanced response, while the generalist LLM is used for query generation.
4. Hybrid RAG Approach: Augmenting Clinical Context
This is a state-of-the-art approach to bridge the semantic gap in clinical data, especially for unstructured notes.
Why Hybrid RAG? Traditional structured queries fail when terms in a user's natural language query (e.g., "signs of hyperglycemia") differ from the terminology in clinical notes (e.g., "polyuria and polydipsia"). Hybrid RAG combines semantic "fuzzy finding" with the precision of structured queries.
4.1. Offline: The Embedding Pipeline (Data Preparation) This process is performed once or periodically as new FHIR data arrives.
• Extract & Chunk:
    ◦ Process FHIR data (e.g., observation.parquet, diagnostic_report.parquet from FHIR Data Pipes pipeline).
    ◦ Extract text-heavy fields (note, conclusion, interpretation) and break them into manageable "chunks".
    ◦ Each chunk retains a reference to its original FHIR resource ID and file source (e.g., Patient 'pat123', Observation Note: 'Patient reports polyuria and polydipsia.' -> Source: {file: 'observation.parquet', id: 'obs-789'}).
• Embed (using Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B):
    ◦ Each text chunk is converted into a vector embedding using the Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B model. This model is a specialized text-embedding model, crucial for capturing the semantic meaning of clinical text.
    ◦ This is where the "Golden Rule" of aligning the model's brain with the data's domain is applied; future enhancements could use even more specialized biomedical text-embedding models (e.g., successors to PubMedBERT).
• Store:
    ◦ These vector embeddings, along with their associated FHIR resource IDs, are loaded into a vector database (e.g., ChromaDB, FAISS). This database is optimized for rapid similarity search.
• OpenMRS Concept Library Integration (Future Phase): This pipeline can be extended to access the OpenMRS CIEL dictionary (via Open Concept Lab or standalone versions) to extract and embed concepts, synonyms, and descriptions. This creates a dedicated embedding database of OpenMRS-specific concepts for highly targeted semantic search.
4.2. Online: The Hybrid RAG Flow at Query Time When a user's query requires understanding of unstructured clinical notes, the clinical_research_agent integrates this semantic search capability.
• Step A (User Query): The user asks a question, e.g., "Does patient_123 show any signs of hyperglycemia?".
• Step B (Semantic Search): The agent takes the user's query ("signs of hyperglycemia"), generates an embedding for it using the Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B model, and queries the vector database. The database returns the most semantically similar text chunks (e.g., the note about "polyuria and polydipsia"), along with their associated FHIR resource IDs.
• Step C (Structured Retrieval): With the list of relevant FHIR resource IDs from the semantic search, the agent performs a precise SQL query (via Spark Thrift) against the Parquet-on-FHIR data store to pull the full, structured FHIR data for only those identified resources (e.g., SELECT * FROM 'observation.parquet' WHERE id IN ('obs-789', 'diag-456');).
• Step D (Synthesis): This combined, highly relevant, and now structured clinical data (from both initial structured queries and the hybrid semantic search) is then injected into a prompt for the MedGemma LLM. MedGemma, being specifically trained on clinical context, synthesizes a high-quality, clinically nuanced answer leveraging all provided data. This leverages MedGemma for its strength in text generation and clinical reasoning, not retrieval.
5. Technical Implementation Details
• LM Studio Integration: A single headless LM Studio server is used to serve all local models (Llama 3 8B Instruct, MedGemma, Gemma 7B Instruct) using their API identifiers. This supports dynamic resource management and on-demand model loading.
• Backend (FastAPI): server/main.py is a lightweight FastAPI server. Its /chat endpoint acts as a bridge, taking the user query from the UI, wrapping it in a standard A2A message, and posting it to the in-memory Message Bus. It then waits for a completed message from the agent pipeline. A /manifest endpoint is exposed for A2A-compliant agent discovery.
• Frontend (Streamlit / HTML/JS): The UI (client/index.html/script.js) provides a dual mode: "Direct" (for direct chat with specific models) and "Agents (A2A)" (for the multi-agent orchestration).
• Configuration: All critical settings (LLM base URLs, API keys, model names, OpenMRS FHIR base URL, Spark Thrift settings, A2A service URLs) are managed via environment variables in a .env file.
• Spark Thrift: The clinical_research_agent explicitly uses PyHive for SQL queries against Parquet-on-FHIR files, enabling interaction with Spark-backed FHIR data repositories.
• Native A2A Services (Future Phase): The architecture is designed for a seamless transition to fully native A2A services. This involves implementing standalone A2A servers for each agent (router, medgemma, clinical research) using the official A2A SDK, which will expose their own Agent Cards at /.well-known/agent.json.
